        <li>4 chicken drumsticks or thighs</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for heat)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken pieces and marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the flour with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or fryer to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the buttermilk marinade, allowing excess to drip off, then dredge in the flour mixture until well coated.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165°F or 74°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken and drain on paper towels. Let rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
