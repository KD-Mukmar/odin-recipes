    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>    
        <li>4 large potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional seasonings: paprika, garlic powder, or herbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel the potatoes. Cut them into thin, even strips (about 1/4 inch thick).</li>
        <li>Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch. This helps achieve a crispier fry.</li>
        <li>Drain and pat the potatoes dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (  175°C).</li>
        <li>Fry the potatoes in batches to avoid overcrowding. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per batch until they are light golden and tender. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C). Fry the potatoes again in batches for an additional 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the fries and drain on fresh paper towels. Immediately season with salt and any optional seasonings while still hot.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauces and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
